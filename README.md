# Performance Evaluation of Conventional Image Classification Approaches
+ mnist_cifar: Implemented machine learning models (*K-Nearest Neighbor*, *Support Vector Machine*, and *Logistic Regression*) for performing image classification on *MNIST* and *CIFAR10* datasets.
+ nn_bp: Constructed a *Neural Network* model **without** utilizing existing frameworks (e.g. *TensorFlow*, *PyTorch*) and carried out *Back Propagation* training for image classification. The trained model acheived 97.14% accuracy on *MNIST* dataset in 735 seconds
